# Tempe Extreme Heat Workshop
## Emergency Response
Co-leads: David Hondula and Rosa Inchausti
In attendance: Shannon Reed(Public info officer), Paul Iniguez, Stephanie Dietrick, Patrick Cutts (communications manager for the police department), Kevin Bailey (deputy chief of police), Doug MacDonald (Code enforcement), Greg(EMS and public health), Greg Ruiz(Fire and Medical rescue).  

End in mind -- one thing that Tempe should do to prevent/respond extreme temperature emergency. High-level recommendations.  

Paul Iniguez: how does extreme heat affect things?  
Patrick -- accidents don't change, so they work to make sure there is plenty of water and car battery (for AC). Business as usual (PD).    
Kevin -- Fire restrict physical training depending on time of year and weather; call additional resources in during the summer months. 3/4 schedule (MWF 24 hour).    
Erie EMS, Greg: Length of shift changes.    
Greg: Different ways of purchasing equipment, moving into the ambulance business, using different mechanisms for cooling the cab of the trucks (non-engine AC units). Work is limited when temperatures is 105 degrees; study the core temps and rehabbing of workforce (blood clotting); reactive business, but are working on increasing the proactive approach for cooling centers and the homeless (water stations and handing out water to homeless); special event water stations (free); restrictions of outdoor special events as a city from the summer.  

No set definition of extreme heat -- Paul Iniguez    

Thresholds: 104-105 developed with Phoenix fire department (core temp research is changing the future). These are in policy. NWS info isn't necessarily being used. Special cases do occur where individuals are removed from duty to their work cycle demands.  

NWS: can support the PD and Fire by delivering specific threshold alerts.   

# Current place  
- What does emergency response and how can the NWS aid their policies and thresholds.  
- Faith-based equity, social equity, and special events.  
- Acclimation issues for guests.   
**Equity lens:** Who are the more disadvantaged and vulnerable or hard to reach populations.  
- The city does a lot for water distributions, but is only from July-August, maybe September. BUT, the heat arrives earlier and stays later.  
- Homeless and the trust of government agency (the marginalized)  
Greg (Erie County): employee with a good relationship with the missions and has developed relationships with the homeless and has nestled into the community. The homeless population is reached through phones.    
Diversity office at Tempe: Building a culture where the city reaches out into the homeless community. But even the departments are doing this on their own. Specifically looking at bus stops as well as the individuals the city hires. The Diversity office helps facilitate these mindsets and cultures within the departments. Building trust by having the hard conversation early and addressing the issues. Outreach officers within PD.  
**If the connections are made, how do you communicate the information to the vulnerable populations:**  
Stephanie -- many of the homeless have technology and so how engage and understand these shifting cultures.  

# One Big Thing  
Fire educates their workforce, but the public education piece, but general public underestimate the impact of dehydration. No water resources near the hiking locations.  
Do people know the signs of dehydration? -- Stephanie  
- some spatial intelligence in parks for people and animals (also splash pads). How do we paint a water resource picture? Some businesses are open to sharing their water resources.  
Do we know who have registry of those with AC and those without?  
- Tempe does not (Rosa).  
- Should it be tied to the building or the people (specifically those who are particularly vulnerable)?  
- Care homes frequently change and so it is hard to track the people and type of usages of the homes.  

Power outages and extreme heat natural disaster policy?  
- EOP connects them itself; but there is no explicit co-occurring natural disasters.  
- Care 7 is an amazing resource to help aid individuals who are in uninhabitable locations.  
- Plans for how to transport people and ensure that temporary positions are safe in heat.  
- Fire assesses the acute situations, but many times there are long-term issues that create acute issues (SCHIZOPHRENIA). Fire knows the resources to contact, but doesn't know what happens in the end. They have to move on to the next call. Some of these things are social issues but the police and fire are the first responders on these issues, even if they are not a safety issue. Funding is needed to address these issues.  
- People know how to get 911 and they can't not respond. Ambulances and 911 are being used as transportation, not as first responders and safety in emergencies.  
- Cooling centers: Tempe does inform public, but the public must take them up on it. Among the transient culture, they know where to get resources. They are not as disconnected as we may think.  
- But the cooling centers are not well-marked.  


## ONE BIG THING  
**_Facilitation structure for repeat callers: How do we get the right resources to the right people at the right time._**  
- A non-emergency contact that is easy to remember and is 24/7.  It will be hard to break the culture of calling 911 because the issue is an emergency to them. They get immediate service from 911, but it is hard to get them out of it. It is a social issue that Tempe does not have all of the resources necessary for this.  
Buffalo: Social services is not sufficient. All these people know is to call 911 because first responders cannot say no. Care 7 for Tempe.  
- We need to get information out on where water and cooling stations are located.
